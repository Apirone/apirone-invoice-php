# Apirone Invoice PHP | SDK

[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg?style=flat-square)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Apirone/apirone-invoce-php/main/LICENSE)

This Library provides classes for working with [Apirone invoices](https://apirone.com/docs/invoices/).
Easy integration of cryptocurrency payments.

## Requirements

- PHP 7.4 or higher with cURL and JSON extentions. Tested up to 8.2.
- MySQL or MariaDB
- [Apirone API PHP](https://github.com/Apirone/apirone-api-php)

## Installation and preparation for use

Use [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) for library installation.

    composer require apirone/apirone-invoice-php

### Assets configure

Copy ```src/assets``` folder into your public html.
On the invoice display page you need to add ```css/styles.css``` and ``js/script.js`` from asssets folder. Also you can use minimized versions.

### Database and Logs handlers

To connect library to your database-engine and log-engine you need to create two callback function and pass them to the library.

Db handler example for php MySQLi
```php

// Our MySQL engine example
$conn = new mysqli('host', 'user', 'pass', 'database');
$conn->select_db('database');

// DB MySQL handler example
$db_handler = static function($query) {
    global $conn;
    $result = $conn->query($query, MYSQLI_STORE_RESULT);

    if (!$result) {
        return $conn->error;
    }
    if (gettype($result) == 'boolean') {
        return $result;
    }
    return $result->fetch_all(MYSQLI_ASSOC);
};

```

Log handler example:

```php
$log_handler = static function($message) {
    // Handle message with yor log engine
    // Message is an associative array with two keys 'body' and 'details'
    // For example you have log function to provide logging
    // log($message['body'], $message['details']);

    print_r($message);
};
```

Set a handlers to the library:

```php
use Apirone\Invoice\Invoice;

Invoice::db($db_handler, 'table_prefix_');
Invoice::log($log_handler);
```

Create an invoce table:

```php
use Apirone\Invoice\Service\InvoiceDb;

// Create invoice table if not exists
InvoiceDb::install('tbale_prefix', $charset = 'urf8', $collate = 'utf_general_ci');
```

For more Datatbase details see [docs/Settings.md](./docs/Database.md)

Create common file for invoce class configure:

```php
// Setup invoice handlers and Settings
Invoice::db($db_handler, $table_prefix);
Invoice::log($log_handler);
Invoice::settings(Settings::fromFile('/absolute/path/to/settings.json'));
```

## Settings

The settings class is used to create an account, manage currency settings, and save and restore the settings object.

Create new settings object:
```php
use Apirone\Invoice\Model\Settings;

$settings = Settings::init();
$settings->createAccount();

// Save settings object to file
$settings->toFile('absolute/path/to/settings.json');

// Get settings as JSON-object to save it to database
$json = $settings->toJson();

```

Load existing settings object

```php
$fromFile = Settings::fromFile('/absolute/path/to/settings.json');

// For example you have get_option function
$json = get_option('apirone_settings');

$fromJson = Settings::fromJson($json);

```

For more Settings class details see [docs/Settings.md](./docs/Settings.md)

## Create an Invoice

```php

use Apirone\Invoice\Invoice;
use Apirone\Invoice\Model\Settings;

// Setup invoice handlers and Settings
Invoice::db($db_handler, $table_prefix);
Invoice::log($log_handler);
Invoice::settings(Settings::fromFile('/absolute/path/to/settings.json'));

$invoice = Invoice::init('btc', 25000);

$invoice->callbackUrl('https://example.com/callback_page');
$invoice->lifetime(1800);

$invoice->crete();

// You can see created invoice JSON data
$json = $invoice->toJson();
```

## Get existing invoice

```php
use Apirone\Invoice\Invoice;
use Apirone\Invoice\Model\Settings;

// Setup invoice handlers and Settings
Invoice::db($db_handler, $table_prefix);
Invoice::log($log_handler);
Invoice::settings(Settings::fromFile('/absolute/path/to/settings.json'));

$id = '9qAs2OQao43VWz72';
$invoice = Invoice::getInvoice($id);

```

## Callbacks handler
Apirone service interacts with the library through [callbacks](https://apirone.com/docs/receiving-callbacks/#invoices).
To get invoice statuses, you need to create a URL and add a callback handler to your code.
This address must be set when creating a new invoice.

If you need to process the order status based on the status of the invoice, you can create a callback function to handle the status change.

```php
// Create oder process function
$order_status_handler = static function ($invoice) {
    // You need to set the order_id when creating an invoice.
    $order_id = $invoice->order();
    // ... Write here your business logic
}
// ... Setup invoice handlers and settings


Invoice::callbackHandler($order_status_handler);
```
## Show invoice

```php
use Apirone\Invoice\Invoice;
use Apirone\Invoice\Model\Settings;

// Setup invoice handlers and Settings
Invoice::db($db_handler, $table_prefix);
Invoice::log($log_handler);
Invoice::settings(Settings::fromFile('/absolute/path/to/settings.json'));

// Set invoice data url - render ajsx response page
Invoice::dataUrl('render_ajax_response.php')

Invoice::renderLoader();
```
